Weather App Development

I developed a responsive and user-friendly weather application utilizing React.js and Bootstrap. The key features of this app include:

Real-Time Weather Information: Users can search for any location to get up-to-date weather details, including temperature, humidity, and weather conditions.

Interactive Map Integration: The app includes an interactive map that visually displays the location of the current weather, enhancing user experience and providing geographical context.
